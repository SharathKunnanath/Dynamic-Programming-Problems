Given a matrix of __n__ by __m__ dimensions, find the minimum cost path to go from cell (0,0) down to cell (n,m). The movement options available are __right__ or __down__ only.

Example:

$$\begin{matrix}
3&2&12&15&10\\
6&19&7&11&17\\
8&5&12&32&21\\
3&20&2&9&7
\end{matrix}$$

What would the minimum cost be to get from cell (0,0) containing the value __3__, to the bottom right cell containing value __7__. See code for solution!
