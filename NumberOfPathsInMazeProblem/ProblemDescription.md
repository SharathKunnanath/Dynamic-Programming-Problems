Given a matrix where a cell has the value of 1 if it's a wall and 0 if not, find the number of ways to go from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, knowing that it's not possible to pass through a wall and we can only go to the right or to the bottom

Example:

$$\begin{matrix}
0&0&1&0&1\\
0&0&0&0&1\\
0&0&1&0&0\\
1&0&0&0&0
\end{matrix}$$

Output: 7
